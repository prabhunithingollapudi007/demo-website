When the college was under the administrative control of the Department of Technical Education, it was affiliated to Osmania University, Hyderabad. With the formation of Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University on 2nd October 1972, it became a constituent college of the University and was later renamed as JNTU College of Engineering, Hyderabad. From its inception in 1965 to 1984, the College was located at Masab Tank. In 1984, the College was shifted to its permanent location at Kukatpally, a 100 acres site, about 20 km from the heart of the City, on Bombay National Highway (NH-9).
